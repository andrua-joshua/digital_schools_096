#Note

The structure of the project is to directly simplify the work for us where by all 
other pages that will be needed to link to are placed in the links folder,
the resources such as external libraries, images, icons and other resources needed to illustrate 
a concept are to be placed in the resources folder.
styles folder to harbour all the stysheets in the web app
scripts folder for all the javaScript codes

####Just mind to follow the hierachy clearly
